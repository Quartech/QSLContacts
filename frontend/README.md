# Angular frontend for QSLContacts app

## Overview
QSLContacts is an Angular frontend that displays a searchable address book of employees of the Governement of British Columbia.

## Development mode
`docker-compose up -d --build` will start the container and serve on port 4200

Livereload doesn't currently work, so to see changes it is necessary to run the above command again. It is not necessary to kill the existing container before re-running docker-compose.
